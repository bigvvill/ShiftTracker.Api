# ShiftTracker

This is an application where you should record a worker's shifts.

You need to create two applications: the Web API and the UI that will call it.

All validation and user input should happen in the UI app.

Your API's controller should be lean. Any logic should be handled in a separate "service".

You should use SQL Server, not SQLite

You should use the "code first" approach to create your database, using Entity Framework's migrations tool.
